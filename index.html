            <h1>Sylhet Flash Floods: <br> Situation & Support</h1>
            <p>Bangladesh has been hit with one of the worst floods in years, with millions in Sylhet and Sunamganj now
                homeless and without any belongings.</p>

            <p>More than 4.3 million people are impacted by the sudden flash flood and water congestion (WHO).
                Meanwhile, millions have been marooned, more than 9 million are homeless, and displaced women and girls
                are now particularly vulnerable whilst they shelter out in the open or in unfamiliar locations. Many
                communities also face the added challenge of a total lack of electricity, meaning they are then unable
                to keep in contact with family members and friends to ensure their safety.</p>

            <h2>Our Donate Plan</h2>
            <p>As of 20 June, there have been thousands of recorded cases of diseases and injuries, including Acute
                Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) - which accounts for 75% of cases - skin, respiratory and eye infections, and
                drowning. One of the most serious concerns also includes the possibility of additional disease outbreaks
                as the water recedes (WHO 2022). The World Health Organisation is currently providing drugs and supplies
                in the worst affected areas, as well as discussing a coordinated preparedness and response to reduce
                death and disease, with emphasis placed on managing drowning and snake bites - the two main causes of
                mortality and morbidity during floods.</p>

            <p>The flood situation in these and other upazilas are predicted to worsen with weather forecasts showing
                further rains this week and next week that may re-flood other areas that are starting to go down. Around
                60-70% of these Upazilas went underwater as the river Kushiara kept rising, with local administrations
                struggling to cope with the ongoing problem and to provide support for the community.</p>
